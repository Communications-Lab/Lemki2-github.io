		<h1>Finding Oneself In NATURE</h1>
        <p>Humans are not the creators, although they have a creative aspect. They are not separate from all that is there. This website is dedicated to reminding this truth we have long forgot, we are not aliens and connecting with all that is and especially nature will bring us home again...</p>
